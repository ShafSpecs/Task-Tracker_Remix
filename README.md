# Remix Task Tracker App

A simple, beginner-friendly app built with Remix 💿 and Prisma ORM. You can check out a [demo](https://task-tracker-remix.vercel.app/) here.

## Motivation

Build a simple Remix app to actually have fun with Remix and gauge my satisfaction with Remix on small-scale apps. I decided to also make this a beginner friendly repository by commenting a lot of what I was doing, and leaving out a lot of obvious improvements to the code for new open sorcerers 🧙‍♂️ (Open Source) and new Remix users to enjoy their first contribution to open source (yes, this app is an open sourced app that I am still building), wether by opening an issue or creating their own PR! 

## Contributing

Want to fix something or add a new feature? Either open a new feature issue or fork this project and create your own PR.

If you've found a bug, please open a new issue and we would be happy to review it 😄.
